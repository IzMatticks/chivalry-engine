                You may open a bounty on another player to enact your revenge. Bounties must be worth at least 
                250,000 Copper Coins. A player may only have one bounty opened on their-self at a time. 
                Bounties will be removed after 3 days if the hit is not carried out. You will not receive a 
                refund if this is the case.<hr />
                You may pay 500,000 Copper Coins to have your identification removed from the listing. This 
                money will be removed from the game.<hr />
                Any player can attempt to carry out a bounty. To receive your pay, you <b>must</b> hospitalize the 
                target. Note that hospitalizing a target will also double their infirmary time.
